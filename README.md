# Richard's image-processing library [![Travis build](https://img.shields.io/travis/rcook/ripl/p-rcook-future.svg?label=Linux%20build)](https://travis-ci.org/rcook/ripl) [![AppVeyor build](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/rcook/ripl/p-rcook-future.svg?label=Windows%20build)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rcook/ripl/branch/p-rcook-future)

## Overview

This is more a historial curiosity than anything else. This is the first "real"
code I ever wrote as a graduate student working in signal processing back in
1998. This code was the main side product of my master's dissertation entitled
"Image-processing techniques with application to image restoration". My coding
skills have come on along a great deal since then.

## Building

I've updated this project to use [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/). Run the
`script/run-cmake` from the root of the repository to create the project's build
system in the `cmake` subdirectory. Other scripts are provided under `script` to
perform builds, run the unit tests and run the binary.

## Licence

Released under the MIT licence.
