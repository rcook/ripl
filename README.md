# Richard's image-processing library

This is more a historial curiosity than anything else. This is the first "real"
code I ever wrote as a graduate student working in signal processing back in
1998. This code was the main side product of my master's dissertation entitled
"Image-processing techniques with application to image restoration". My coding
skills have come on along a great deal since then.
