# Richard's image-processing library

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/rcook/ripl.png)](https://travis-ci.org/rcook/ripl)

## Overview

This is more a historial curiosity than anything else. This is the first "real"
code I ever wrote as a graduate student working in signal processing back in
1998. This code was the main side product of my master's dissertation entitled
"Image-processing techniques with application to image restoration". My coding
skills have come on along a great deal since then.

## Building

I've updated this project to use [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/). Run the
`script/run-cmake` from the root of the repository to create the project's build
system in the `cmake` subdirectory. Other scripts are provided under `script` to
perform builds, run the unit tests and run the binary.

## Licence

Released under the MIT licence.
