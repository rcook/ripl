Ripl toolboxes:
        riplfft:        Fast Fourier transform toolbox;
                        includes 1D and 2D complex-complex and
                        real-complex transforms along with 1D
                        sine and cosine transforms. Will eventually
                        extend sine and cosine transforms to 2D.
        riplrand:       Random-number generator toolbox: uniform,
                        exponential and Gaussian generators.
        riplwave:       Wavelet transform toolbox:
                        includes 1D, 2D and multidimensional wavelet
                        transform routines and functions for generating
                        4-, 12- and 20-coefficient Daubechies wavelet
                        filter coefficients.
