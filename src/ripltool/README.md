# Ripl toolboxes

## `riplfft`

* Fast Fourier transform toolbox
* Includes 1D and 2D complex-complex and real-complex transforms along with 1D
sine and cosine transforms
* Will eventually extend sine and cosine transforms to 2D

## `riplrand`

* Random-number generator toolbox
* Uniform, exponential and Gaussian generators

## `riplwave`

* Wavelet transform toolbox
* Includes 1D, 2D and multidimensional wavelet transform routines and functions
for generating 4-, 12- and 20-coefficient Daubechies wavelet filter coefficients
